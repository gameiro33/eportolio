										<h1>Individual Reflection</h1>
									</header>
									<p>A digital forensics agent. An Individual Reflection has been done, using Rolfe et al.’s (2001) Approach. For each piece of work, the What, So What, Now What Structures have been followed.</p>

									<h2>1.	Agent Communication</h2>
									<h3>1.1	What?</h3>
									<p>Created an agent dialogue between Alice and Bob about TV inventory using KQML for message structure and KIF for knowledge representation. The conversation covered TV stock and HDMI port count.</p>
									
									<h3>1.2	So What?</h3>
									<p>This exercise demonstrated the importance of standardized protocols in multi-agent communication. KQML and KIF enabled structured, machine-readable dialogue, crucial for building interoperable systems in e-commerce and supply chain management.</p>
									
									<h3>1.3	Now What?</h3>
									<p>Explore more complex scenarios and implement in an actual multi-agent system. Investigate modern alternatives to KQML/KIF like FIPA-ACL or semantic web technologies for future projects requiring sophisticated agent communication.</p>
									
									<h2>2.	Individual Project</h2>
									<h3>2.1	What?</h3>
									<p>My contributions were as follows: Proofread and typo detected, enriched the Introduction with scholarly references, positioning this work as a tool for forensic investigation), placement of the UML diagrams with captions, creation of the Annex with the Python code and additional content, adding the final word count below the main title, adding a short Conclusion, enrichment and formating review of Reference list, added Related work: analysis of a real-world forensics process and how the agents we developed can fit there, with scholarly references.</p>
									
									
									<h3>2.2	So What?</h3>
									<p>These contributions enhanced the document's technical accuracy, academic rigor, and practical relevance. The additions improved its visual communication, provided implementable content, and strengthened its academic foundation. The result is a more comprehensive, professionally presented, and useful document in the field of forensic investigation.</p>
									
									<h3>2.3	Now What?</h3>
									<p>Even though we provided code for the agents, there is no intelligence infused in the project. As for next steps, it would be interesting to code or infuse AI components, including them in the process.</p>
									
									<h2>3.	Parse Trees</h2>
									<h3>3.1	What?</h3>
									<p>Python script using NLTK  to generate constituency-based parse trees for given sentences (NLTK, 2024). Defines grammar, tokenizes input, and visualizes unique trees.</p>
									
									<h3>3.2	So What?</h3>
									<p>Provides visual representation of sentence structure, crucial for understanding language organization. Reveals hierarchical nature of language, useful for various NLP tasks.</p>
									
									<h3>3.3	Now What?</h3>
									<p>The code is too rigid as the parsetree string elements needs to be clearly detailed in the grammar variable using the nltk.CFG.fromstring() function. For future, expand grammar for complex structures, incorporate into larger NLP projects (e.g., chatbots, summarization tools). Explore applications in language acquisition and cognitive linguistics research.</p>

									<h2>4.	Deep Learning</h2>
									<h3>4.1	What?</h3>
									<p>Deep Learning overview, including a synopsis of how it works. Advancements and positive impacts to society are mentioned, together with potential risks such as bias, privacy and transparency (Sharifani & Amini, 2023).</p>
									
									<h3>4.2	So What?</h3>
									<p>As Deep Learning is a widely transformative technology, it will deeply impact how we live our lives. It is of importance to carefully consider how a safe and fair implementation of it can be achived.</p>
									
									<h3>4.3	Now What?</h3>
									<p>I will go forward with increasingly complex Deep Learning implementations, but at the same time make sure that the risks related with my code are mitigated.</p>
									
									<h2>5.	Individual Project</h2>
									<h3>5.1	What?</h3>
									<p>Expanding on the group project, for this submission I: added a new AI Agent to the workflow - Content Analysis, Improved the JSON output of the workflow, Added Unit Test Coverage for the workflow, Added Integration Tests for the Open AI integration, Added a README.txt file to the GitHub Repository to guide the user through the installation and execution of the project. All of this was presented, including videos of the run for the unit and integration tests and two functional tests, with and without suspicious files.</p>
									
									<h3>5.2	So What?</h3>
									<p>These improvements significantly enhance the project's functionality, reliability, and user-friendliness. The addition of the Content Analysis AI Agent expands the workflow's capabilities, potentially leading to more insightful and comprehensive results. Improving the JSON output streamlines data handling and integration with other systems. The increased test coverage, including both unit and integration tests, ensures greater reliability and easier maintenance of the codebase. This is particularly crucial for the OpenAI integration, a core component of the project. The README file addition makes the project more accessible to new users and contributors, potentially increasing its adoption and fostering collaboration.</p>
									
									<h3>5.3	Now What?</h3>
									<p>I would like to expand my knowledge with a more complex scenario, not relying in OpenAI’s capabilities. It would be interesting to modify the code to include inter-agent communication protocols such as KQML and KIF. It would also be interesting to have the system send an email notification summarizing the Forensics run and alert if any suspicious document has been found.</p>
